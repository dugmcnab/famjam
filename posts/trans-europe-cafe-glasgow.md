Good city centre location, you can generally get a seat and the maps around the walls keep the kids entertained!

They serve gourmet sandwiches, classic Continental-style coffees, all-day breakfasts, French Toast and excellent Sunday brunches.

In addition to fresh food and hot drinks, you'll also find a selection of fine beers and wines from the regions traversed by the Trans-Europe Express.
